# Prediction-on-Iris-dataset-
The aim of this project is to identify the type of the flower using Decision tree
The purpose of this project is if we feed any new data to this classifier,it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
It is important to import necessary libraries
DecisionTreeClassifier is the package need to be installed from sklearn.Tree.This is used to build decision tree based on the given features.
After loading the dataset,it has to be checked for the presence of anomalies and outliers.If any anomalies are present, the data should be normalized,so as to build the decision tree classifier.
Splitting the dataset
The data has to be splitted into train_data and test_data.The decision tree classifier is built using the training data.
The built decision tree classifier is tested using the test_data
The performance of the model is measured using confusion matrix.
Visualization is done using different plots
